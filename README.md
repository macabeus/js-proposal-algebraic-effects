# Why?

No more **function color**! Yes **one-shot delimited continuation**!

What the hell?! Well... I **really** recommend that you read [this blog post by Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/) explaining algebraic effects - and how it could be very useful on our JavaScript code!

This project is a runnable POC with a Babel's "plugin", so you could write some code and taste this new concept in JavaScript. Its features, syntax, and goals are very inspired by Dan Abramov's blog post mentioned above. In short, with algebraic effects, you could separate _what_ from the _how_ and have fewer refactors.

# What does it add to the language?

Again, the syntax needs to be improved. But at this moment we have:

- **Expression `perform <value>`**

You could use this keyword inside of any function (not arrow functions!) in order to launch an effect.<br />
Similar to `throw`, it'll search for the closest `try/handle` at call stack to perform an effect passing `<value>` as the effect name. Unlike `throw`, `perform` is an expression and will return a value.

```js
if (name === nulll) {
 name = perform 'ask_name'
}
```

- **Block `handle` at `try`**

Just like the `catch` block, you should use it to handle the effect launched inside of the `try` block. In the scope of `handle`, it is implicitly injected a variable called `effect`, with the `<value>` from `perform`.

```js
try {
 ...
} handle {
 if (effect === 'ask_name') {
   ...
 }
}
```

- **Statement `resume`**

It should be used inside of the `handle` block in order to resume the `perform` expression, returning a value.

```js
if (effect === 'ask_name') {
 resume 'Arya Stark'
}
```

One of its most powerful features is to use inside a block with an async operation so you could call an async operator without the need to use an async/await operators on the function - that is, less refactors and a function could be sync and async at the same time!

```js
if (effect === 'ask_name') {
 setTimeout(() => {
   resume 'Arya Stark';
 }, 1000);
}
```

- **operator `@@`**

Unfortunately, we still can't inject implicitly the effects inside of a function call outside of the `try` block, so you should use `@@` at a function call that could launch effects.

```js
function getName(user) {
 let name = user.name;
 if (name === null) {
   name = perform 'ask_name';
 }

 return name;
}

function displayNameCapitalized(user) {
 const name = getName@@(user) // need to use @@
 console.log(name.toUpperCase())
}

const arya = { name: null };

try {
 displayNameCapitalized(arya); // doesn't need to use @@
} handle {
 ...
}
```

# How to run

1 - Clone this repo:

```
> git clone git@github.com:macabeus/js-proposal-algebraic-effects.git
```

2 - Run some commands on Babel:

```
> cd babel
> make bootstrap
> make watch
```

3 - So you could compile [the sample](https://github.com/macabeus/js-proposal-algebraic-effects/blob/master/samples/basic.js) with:

```
> cd babel-algebraic-effects
> yarn start
```
