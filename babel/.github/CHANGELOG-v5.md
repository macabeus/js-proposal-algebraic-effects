 * **Internal**
  * Add scary warning for those few who choose to use the WIP experimental transformers.

This is fine now since class properties aren't supported in any engine that supports classes but the `es7.classProperties` transformer will need to be updated in the future to desugar to ES6 classes instead of relying on the `es6.classes` transformer from being ran.

  * Fix `module` being incorrectly rewritten when used as in an export declaration.
  * When performing single-reference inlining, ensure that the single reference isn't a child of the binding itself.
  * Fix a bug in `minification.deadCodeElimination` where a new binding instance was being created for local class bindings instead of just inheriting the parent one.
  * Fix bug with paren printing in `compact` and `retainLines` mode where a left paren was already printed before catching up.
 * **Internal**
  * Handle contexts for paths much better. This will ensure that the path node location info is in sync.

## 5.4.2

 * **Polish**
  * `ignore` and `only` patterns are now **very** liberal. The pattern can now exist anywhere in the path.

## 5.4.1

 * **Bug Fix**
  * Add missing `slash` dependency. Thanks [@browncolyn](https://github.com/browncolyn)!
 * **Polish**
  * Clean up `shouldIgnore` algorithm to work how you'd expect rather than being a hacky piece of shit. It now crawls the entire path, checking each section of it against the input ignore/only patterns. This means that the pattern `foo` will ignore the paths `foo/bar.js`, `bar/foo` etc.

 * **New Feature**
  * Added [function bind syntax](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-function-bind) behind stage 0. Thanks [@RReverser](https://github.com/rreverser)!

 * **Polish**
  * Normalise path separators for souce map paths when using `$ babel`.
  * Rework `PathHoister` to ignore global references and to not deopt on reassignments to referenced bindings, instead it tries to hoist to the highest scope.
  * Added missing exponential operator inlining. Thanks [@nkt](https://github.com/nkt)!
  * Optimise `regenerator` transformer. Thanks [@benjamn](https://github.com/benjamn)!

## 5.3.3

 * **Spec Compliance**
  * Allow trailing param commas for methods when using the `es7.trailingCommas` transformer.
 * **Bug Fix**
  * Fix `es6.blockScoping` transformer not properly ignoring `break` in `SwitchCase`.
  * Fix lookahead context saving to avoid weird tokenizer state.
  * Explode duplicate identifiers in export/import specifiers and property shorthand to create unique objects.
  * Skip loose mode for class methods when they have decorators.
  * When removing nodes, share their comments with their siblings.
  * Properly hoist temp param declarations when doing TCO.
 * **Internal**
  * Add `--harmony_generators` flag to `$ babel-node`.
  * Internal AST traversals have been minimised **drastically**. Transformers have been grouped together which means entire tree traversals are much fewer. Visiting nodes is now also skipped if the traversal context can detect that the handler is a noop. This sames precious cycles as it avoids constructing traversal paths and creating a new traversal context. See issues [#1472](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/1472) and [#1486](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/1486) for related discussion.
 * **Polish**

  * Consolidate notion of "virtual types".

## 5.2.12

 * **Polish**
  * Make UID generation based on module declarations **much** nicer.
 * **Internal**
  * Remove internal check for traversal path replacement of self. This is a pattern that **could** come up in the wild and it could lead to pretty nasty code and may lead to internal regressions as the test coverage isn't 100% :( Instead, just put it in the fast path.

## 5.2.11

 * **Internal**
  * Rename `getModuleName` option to `getModuleId`, doh.

## 5.2.10

 * **Bug Fix**
  * Fix numerous issues in `replaceWithSourceString`. Thanks [@pangratz](https://github.com/pangratz)!

  * Move `utility.deadCodeElimination` transformer up to avoid race conditions.
  * Fix shorthand property scope binding renaming.
 * **Polish**
  * Turn helper variable declarations into function declarations if possible.
 * **Internal**
  * Removed native inheritance support from classes.
  * Added `replaceWithSourceString` path API.
  * Split up `es3.propertyLiterals` and `es3.memberExpressionLiterals` transformers to `minification.propertyLiterals` and `es3.memberExpressionLiterals`.

## 5.2.6

 * **Internal**
  * Fix transformer aliases being accidentally set as deprecated ones.
  * Expose `Pipeline` as `TransformerPipeline` instead.

## 5.2.5

 * **Bug Fix**
  * Fix `parse` API not adding all the correct pipeline transformers.

## 5.2.4

## 5.2.3

  * Fix plugin containers being called with an undefined import. Thanks [@timbur](https://github.com/timbur)!
  * Allow Flow object separators to be commas. Thanks [@monsanto](https://github.com/monsanto)!
  * Add missing `Statement` and `Declaration` node aliases to flow types.

## 5.2.2

 * **Internal**
  * Allow `util.arrayify` to take arbitrary types and coerce it into an array.

## 5.2.1

 * **Bug Fix**
  * Fix regression in `node/register` that caused `node_modules` to not be ignored.

## 5.2.0

 * **Bug Fix**
  * Fix plugin strings splitting arbitrarily on `:` which caused full paths on Windows to fail as they include `:` after the drive letter.
  * Call class property `initializer`s with their target instead of their descriptor.
  * Fix `ignore` and `only` not properly working on Windows path separators. Thanks [@stagas](https://github.com/stagas)!
  * Fix `resolveRc` running on files twice causing issues. Thanks [@lukescott](https://github.com/lukescott)!
  * Fix shorthand properties not correctly being target for `isReferenced` checks. Thanks [@monsanto](https://github.com/monsanto)!
 * **Polish**
  * Allow passing an array of globs to `babel/register` `only` and `ignore` options. Thanks [@Mark-Simulacrum](https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum)!
  * When inferring function names that collide with upper bindings, instead of doing the wrapper, instead rename them.
  * Consider constant-like variable declaration functions to always refer to themselves so TOC can be performed.
  * Process globs manually when using `$ babel` as some shells such as Windows don't explode them. Thanks [@jden](https://github.com/jden)!
  * Add alternative way to execute plugins via a closure that's called with the current Babel instance.
 * **Internal**
  * Remove multiple internal transformers in favor of directly doing things when we need to. Previously, declarations such as `_ref` that we needed to create in specific scopes were done at the very end via the `_declarations` transformer. Now, they're done and added to the scope **right** when they're needed. This gets rid of the crappy `_declarations` property on scope nodes and fixes the crappy regenerator bug where it was creating a new `BlockStatement` so the declarations were being lost.
  * Rework transformer traversal optimisation. Turns out that calling a `check` function for **every single node** in the AST is ridiculously expensive. 300,000 nodes timesed by ~30 transformers meant that it took tens of seconds to perform while it's quicker to just do the unnecessary traversal. Seems obvious in hindsight.
 * **New Feature**
  * Add `jscript` transformer that turns named function expressions into function declarations to get around [JScript's horribly broken function expression semantics](https://kangax.github.io/nfe/#jscript-bugs). Thanks [@kondi](https://github.com/kondi)!
  * Add `@@hasInstance` support to objects when using the `es6.spec.symbols` transformer.
  * Add `retainLines` option that retains the line (but not the columns!) of the input code.
